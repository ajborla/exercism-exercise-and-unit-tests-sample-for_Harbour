## Overview
## Installation
## Usage

## Acknowledgements
The author frequently referred to, and adapted, the unit tests in the [Exercism Bash Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash). Many thanks to the authors of those tests for their work, particularly, the clarity of test names, and the addition of extra tests.

More generally, thanks to the volunteers who have, and continue to, develop _Harbour_, as well as those enthusiasts writing and hosting _Harbour_ code and documentary resources, so helping to keep a historically rich, and important, legacy, alive into the 21st Century.

## TODO
Assuming acceptance of this proposal, commence working on the newly-created repositories:

`https://github.com/exercism/harbour`

and:

`https://github.com/exercism/harbour-test-runner`

The author expects to effect the transference of current repository contents to the new track.

However, should there be interest, welcomes contributions in the form of new exercises. These should be quite straightforward to implement since committed exercises may be used as templates.
